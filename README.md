<h3>Description of the exam  </h3>

- ü§î &nbsp;
For every student of a school,we know the places where they traveled during theholidays (the data is given with pairs: student number, place of travel). The students who have been in more than one place give more data pairs about themselves. We form groups of students who vacationedin exactly the same places (each of these groups should have the largest possible size). Write a program that determines the following:1.The total number of places where the students traveled.2.The number of visited places for each student.3.The place where most students were.4.A student who did not travel anywhere.5.How many groups of studentscan be made according to the principle in the task descrip-tion?

- ****Input**** <br>
the first line of the standard inputcontainsthe number of students (1‚â§N‚â§1000), and the number of data pairs (1‚â§M‚â§2000). In the next M*2 lines, there is a data pair in every two lines: the identifier number of a student (1‚â§Si‚â§N), and aplace of travel (a word with at most 10 letters of the English alphabet). Every student has been to at most 10 places, the total number of places does not exceed 1000.Nobody visited a place twice.
- ****OutPut**** <br> 
standard outputshould contain a line with a single # character before the solution ofeach subtask. This # character line is followed by as many lines as needed for the output of a subtask. If you cannot solve a subtask, you should output only the line containing the # character. If the output format is not correct (less/more # characters are in the output), you will get ‚ÄúOutput format error‚Äù, even if you have correct solutions for some subtasks.
